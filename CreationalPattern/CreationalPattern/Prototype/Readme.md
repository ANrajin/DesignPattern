Prototype Design Pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical 
instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype

Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to create new objects from the existing instance of the object. 
That means it clone the existing object with its data into a new object. If we do any changes to the cloned 
object (i.e. new object) then it does not affect the original object.
